> This includes the frontend for Open-Certs.

After seeing so many open-source projects being monetized without giving any recognition to contributors, Open-Certs comes with the vision to certify every open-source contribution.

Open-Certs frontend is based on component-based architecture. It takes advantage of `Reactjs` as UI library, `Typescript` as programming language, `TailwindCSS`, `Material-UI`, etc and consumes [Open-Certs-Backend](https://github.com/open-certs/oc-backend) to delivery required services to the users.
