> This includes the frontend for Open-Certs. 📜

After seeing so many open-source projects being monetized :dollar: without giving any recognition to contributors, Open-Certs comes with the vision to certify every open-source contribution :tickets:.

It really is that easy! 💚

And the best part of it? **Open-Certs is open source!** 🤩

You can also contribute to it 🏆.

**The website is live and can be visited on https://open-certs.dev/** 😃

## Major Objective :pushpin:	

- To let beginners venture into the world of Open Source.
- To provide validation to every open-source contribution.
<br><br>
## Tech Stack 💻

Open-Certs frontend is based on component-based architecture. It takes advantage of `Reactjs` as UI library, `Typescript` as programming language, `TailwindCSS`, `Material-UI`, etc and consumes [Open-Certs-Backend](https://github.com/open-certs/oc-backend) to delivery required services to the users.
<br><br>
## Set Up 🔨

- To get started, install the required node modules:

```
yarn install
```

- Then copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and configure it.
<br><br>
## Running the application locally ⚙️

Then issue the following command to run the server:

```
yarn start
```
<br><br>

## Contribution Guidelines 📋	

- Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/open-certs/oc-frontend/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file for contributing towards the project.
- If you are creating an issue, please make sure that it is a valid and significant issue that will actually contribute towards the project.
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages 📧.
- Make sure your PR's description is clear and it mentions the issue number that your PR fixes.
- When you're submitting a PR, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot 📸 or video 📽️ of your change or a link 🔗 to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
- When you make very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterwards so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at [here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))
